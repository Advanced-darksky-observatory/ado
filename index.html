                                The Advanced Darksky Observatory at IIT Hyderabad is the first in-campus research observatory 
                                among all IITs which aims to provide both cutting edge astronomy and engineering research.  
                                It was inaugurated by Dr. K. Radhakrishnan (former Chairman, ISRO) on 28th February, 2023

                                    delivering outstanding performance on both Planetary and Deep-Sky objects. 
                                    It comes with Sky-Watcher's signature SynScan Goto function which 
                                    makes our observation experience smoother. The elegant and rigid all-metal 
                                    truss tube design is easily transportable when unassembled, and can be assembled 
                                    and ready for use in about 20 minutes. The mount provides motorised operation in 
                                    both Alt and Azimuth axes, and can slew the telescope automatically, and track over 
                                    42,900-night sky objects from the Synscan handset's extensive computerised database. 
                                    It features Freedom-Find™ Dual-Encoder technology, which also allows the telescope to be 
                                    moved manually in either axis without losing its alignment or positional information, 
                                    giving us enormous convenience and flexibility during observing sessions.

                                    QHY9701 is a cooled scientific CMOS camera with GSENSE9701 back illuminated sCMOS sensor. 
                                    The CMOS has a very wide spectral response. With the characteristics of large pixels, 
                                    ultra-wide spectrum and low noise, it is suitable for high-end microscopy, micro-optics, 
                                    biofluorescence, astronomy and other scientific research fields. It has 89% peak QE at 610nm. 
                                    The high, wide response from NIR to UV makes the QHY9701 a perfect camera for spectrum 
                                    analysis and spectrum imaging systems. The QHY9701 is also an ideal scientific CMOS camera 
                                    for Fluorescence imaging.

                                    The QHYCFW3 series filter wheel hosts 7 filters from violet to red in the visible spectrum. 
                                    QHYCFW3 filter wheels can be controlled by either an independent external program using the 
                                    filter wheel’s USB port or via a special 4-pin port. When connected to the QHY 4-pin port 
                                    there is no need for an additional power cable or control program. All of the filter wheel
